00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,054
Hi!  I'm Richard Stallman, leader of the Free Software Movement

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:06,870
and founder of the GNU project

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,501
which developed the free software operating system GNU

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:15,660
Welcome to this course "The Road to the Free Digital Society"

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:20,353
In this course we will cover issues of human rights

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:26,529
that arise from computing. We will talk about threats to the Free Digital Society

7
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:30,275
Will explain what Free Software means

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:36,085
and what makes a program free and how you make your programs free

9
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:39,946
We will talk about copyright law

10
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:43,293
and copyleft which is based on it

11
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:50,176
We'll talk about how these freedom issues do or don't apply to other kinds of digital works

12
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,715
besides software

13
00:00:51,815 --> 00:01:00,522
We will recognize some of the propaganda used  by the opponents of digital freedom

14
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:03,313
and how to avoid repeating it

15
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:07,464
And we will talk about some of the thin changes

16
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:11,565
we need to make (some of us) in our own lifestyles

17
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:17,218
so that we recover some of the digital freedom that many have lost

18
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:23,495
Happy hacking! And I hope this course will get you started on the path to freedom.
